# BlackBox ~ An Android app
BlackBox is a fun game for groups of friends where a random `Who?` question is asked each round. The players then get to vote anonymously on any person in the group (including themselves).
The results will be shown when everyone has voted: The person with the most votes, the top three voted people this round and the top three voted group members of all rounds combined.

The app can be downloaded from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.dezijwegel.blackbox&hl=en_US)
