# Blackbox, a mobile party game to play with friends!

**Each round you are asked a ‘who?’ question. Vote anonymously on the friend that fits the statement most in your opinion.**
(E.g: Who has the best dance moves, who is the clumsiest,...)

After each round the results are shown together with the all-time winners. 


Choose between different categories with more than *120 questions* combined!

* **+18**: Spicy questions, aimed at adults
* **Beer o'clock**: Questions involving partying and drinking
* **Superstar**: Admire your friends’ actions or abilities
* **Character traits**: Questions about your friends’ character traits
* **Casual**: General black box questions, a rather soft category. Great to get started.
* **Friendship killers**: The biggest friendship test, your friendship can handle anything if it survives this category

Pick one or more when creating your game.
